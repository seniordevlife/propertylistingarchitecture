# ATM Transaction Processing System
### Scenario
As a developer for a property listing company, I was tasked with designing and implementing a backend solution that would manage the company's property listings using .NET and C# technologies. The solution should also integrate with an Azure SQL database and use Entity Framework for data access.

### Technical Requirements
I designed a transaction processing system that allows users retrieve a list of properties, add a new property, edit an existing property, delete a property and filter properties based on certain criteria. The system is built using the following technologies and tools:

- Backend: C# and .NET
- Database: Azure SQL
- Data Access: Entity Framework
- Container Orchestration: Docker

### Installation and Setup
To run the backend solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using NuGet Package Manager
3. Update the connection string in the appsettings.json file to point to your Azure SQL database
4. Start the backend server using Visual Studio or the command dotnet run in the backend directory

### Usage
The backend solution allows users to:

- Retrieve a list of properties by sending a GET request to the appropriate endpoint
- Add a new property by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint
- Edit an existing property by sending a PUT request to the appropriate endpoint
- Delete a property by sending a DELETE request to the appropriate endpoint
- Filter properties based on certain criteria by sending a GET request with query parameters
